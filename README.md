The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

Image processing pipeline

Following flow chart will be described how this image processing pipeline development thing happening advanced computer vision techniques.


Camera calibration

Camera resectioning determines which incoming light is associated with each pixel on the resulting image [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_resectioning)]
